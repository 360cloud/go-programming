# Section 6.10 Conditional - Switch Statement
  
In this section, we are going to look at the `switch` statement. This is all part of [control flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow), which is sequential, iterative (loops), and conditional; control flow is how computers read your program.  
  
By default, it is sequential. You can control the _flow_ of how computers are reading your program with something like an iterative, using the `for` keyword, you can also use a conditional; an `if` statement or a `switch` statement.  
  
A `switch` statement always starts with the keyword `switch`, think "Hey, I want to switch on something."  
  
In addition to the `switch` keyword, a `switch` statement has `case`s. The `switch` statement switches on some `case`.  
  
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	switch {
	case false:
		fmt.Println("this should not print")
	case (2==4):
		fmt.Println("this should not print2")
	case (3==3):
		fmt.Println("prints")
	case (4==4):
		fmt.Println("also true, does it print?")
	}
}

```

In the above, the first `case` that evaluates to true `3==3` run the code speficied `fmt.Println("prints")` and the switch statement exits. There is no fallthrough by default in a `switch` statement in Go, unless it is specified, which is why the final`case` here `4==4` does not return. Let's specify `fallthrough` and see what happens.  
  
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	switch {
	case false:
		fmt.Println("this should not print")
	case (2==4):
		fmt.Println("this should not print2")
	case (3==3):
		fmt.Println("prints")
		fallthrough
	case (4==4):
		fmt.Println("also true, does it print?")
	}
}

```
